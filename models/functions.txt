The setattr() function in Python is used to set the value of an attribute of an object. It takes three parameters:

Object: The object whose attribute needs to be set.
Attribute Name (as a string): The name of the attribute to be set.
Value: The value to be assigned to the attribute.
Here's the syntax of setattr():

python
Copy code
setattr(object, attribute_name, value)
For example, suppose you have a class MyClass with an attribute name, and you want to set its value:

python
Copy code
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()

setattr(obj, 'name', 'John')
This is equivalent to:

python
Copy code
obj.name = 'John'
You can use setattr() when the attribute name is determined dynamically or when you want to set attributes based on some condition or loop iteration. It provides a more flexible way to set attributes compared to direct assignment. In your context, setattr(self, key, value) is dynamically setting attributes of the BaseModel instance based on the key-value pairs in kwargs.




The strptime() function in Python is part of the datetime module and is used to parse strings into datetime objects. It stands for "string parse time".

Here's the syntax of strptime():

python
Copy code
datetime.strptime(date_string, format)
date_string: This is the string containing the date and time information that you want to convert to a datetime object.
format: This is the format string specifying the format of the date_string. It tells Python how to interpret the string to extract the date and time components.
The format string consists of various format codes that represent different components of the date and time. For example:

%Y: Four-digit year (e.g., 2022).
%m: Two-digit month (01 to 12).
%d: Two-digit day (01 to 31).
%H: Hour (24-hour clock) (00 to 23).
%M: Minute (00 to 59).
%S: Second (00 to 59).
%f: Microsecond (000000 to 999999).
You specify the format codes in the format string to match the corresponding parts of the date_string. For example, if your date_string is in the format "2022-01-30 08:15:30", you would use the format string "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" to parse it.

Here's an example usage:

python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime

date_string = "2022-01-30 08:15:30"
format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

parsed_date = datetime.strptime(date_string, format)
print(parsed_date)
This would output:

yaml
Copy code
2022-01-30 08:15:30
strptime() is useful when you have date and time information in string format and need to convert it to a datetime object for further manipulation or comparison.
